      title: Case study comparing RAG on single modality against UniversalRAG (Ours)
      caption: Traditional RAG models are limited by modality-specific retrieval, often missing relevant knowledge from other modalities. UniversalRAG (Ours) dynamically routes each query to the most appropriate modality, enabling more accurate retrieval and response generation.

      title: Case study comparing different levels of text granularity
      caption: The user query requires complex retrieval involving multiple entities. ParagraphRAG retrieves limited context centered around a single entity, leading to an incorrect answer. UniversalRAG (Ours) routes the query to the document corpus and retrieves richer document-level information, allowing it to capture both relevant entities and generate the correct response.

      title: Case study comparing different levels of video granularity
      caption: The user query requires only a segment of the video to determine the answer. VideoRAG retrieves a broad range of frames across the video, which may include irrelevant content or miss key frames, leading to an incorrect response. UniversalRAG (Ours) routes the query to the clip-level granularity, retrieving more focused and relevant visual information, enabling it to generate the correct response.

      title: Case study comparing UniversalRAG across uni-modal and cross-modal scenarios
      caption: In the uni-modal setup, where only a single prominent modality is used, information can sometimes be incomplete as they require evidence across modalities. UniversalRAG (Ours), with its cross-modal capability, gathers evidence from multiple modalities to generate a more comprehensive response.
