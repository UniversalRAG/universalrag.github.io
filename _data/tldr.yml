  Conceptual illustration comparing existing RAG strategies with our proposed UniversalRAG.
  1. RAG with Single Modality struggles to handle queries requiring modalities other than one in the corpus.
  2. RAG with Single Granularity lacks flexibility in granularity, resulting in overly fine or overly coarse information.
  3. RAG with Single Unified Corpus causes modality gaps that bias retrieval toward the modality of the query.
  4. Our **UniversalRAG** overcomes these limitations via a **modality- and granularity-aware routing** mechanism over diverse corpora.
